<h2>Our First Meeting at the Library</h2>
<time>May 2, 2025</time>
<p>This was the first time that I have ever met you in real life. Waiting in the end of the corridor for you to arrive during our long awaited lunch break, my heart was pumping fast, and my brain going back through everything to make sure that I was prepared to meet you. Seeing you in that brown dress made me even more nervous. You were so beautiful, more than any picture have captured before. Having you siting next to me was a blessing. I knew that something is about to change my life forever.</p>

<p>After a whole month of texting till midnight, sharing tons of our daily lives while the other was asleep, fighting against distance and time difference, our love finally made it! I can't believe how we managed to pass this obstacle so well and fought so much for our relationship. Our Japan date was also one of the best days I've ever had with you! Exploring a new country with you somehow made me fall in love with you even more too :0 I hope that is our first and definitely not the last time!</p>

<h2>Our First Big Fight</h2>
<time>September 27, 2024</time>
<img alt="Our first fight" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustinSunOneYear/love-timeline/main/fight.PNG"/>
<p>This is the first of our biggest fight. It was a night with not much sleep, but looking back every fight made us closer to each other. As we've have always said, we don't go to bed mad, and I hope that communication will always help us in our relationship. I know that sometimes I am not the best boyfriend that makes you the happiest, but I will always try my best to become who you have dreamt of, and give you the life you want. Remember that no matter what happens, I love you with all my heart</p>
