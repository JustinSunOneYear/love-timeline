<h2>Our First Meeting at the Library</h2>
<time>May 2, 2025</time>
<p>This was the first time that I have ever met you in real life. Waiting in the end of the corridor for you to arrive during our long awaited lunch break, my heart was pumping fast, and my brain going back through everything to make sure that I was prepared to meet you. Seeing you in that brown dress made me even more nervous. You were so beautiful, more than any picture have captured before. Having you siting next to me was a blessing. I knew that something is about to change my life forever.</p>

<p>After a whole month of texting till midnight, sharing tons of our daily lives while the other was asleep, fighting against distance and time difference, our love finally made it! I can't believe how we managed to pass this obstacle so well and fought so much for our relationship. Our Japan date was also one of the best days I've ever had with you! Exploring a new country with you somehow made me fall in love with you even more too :0 I hope that is our first and definitely not the last time!</p>

<p>This is the first of our biggest fight. It was a night with not much sleep, but looking back every fight made us closer to each other. As we've have always said, we don't go to bed mad, and I hope that communication will always help us in our relationship. I know that sometimes I am not the best boyfriend that makes you the happiest, but I will always try my best to become who you have dreamt of, and give you the life you want. Remember that no matter what happens, I love you with all my heart</p>

<h2>ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY</h2>
<p>WE DID IT! This is such an important and valuable milestone for our relationship. Despite many arguments and fights, combined with tons of fun moments and lovely memories, we have reach our first one year anniversary. Time passes so fast with you my love, and I can't believe that we have gone this far. Sometimes I wonder if my life is going to end too quickly because time with you just flashes by. I don't know, but even if that was the case I would still choose to be with you no matter what. Joanna you means the absolute world to me, and one year is a big achievement, but also only the start of a beautiful love story. I know that we have a lot more to come, a ton of new memories to add to this website, many places to travel together to, lots of new food to eat together, and lots and lots of time with the love of my life. Happy One Year Joanna Baby. This website was created to commemorate this exact milestone. And don't forget that I love you.</p>
